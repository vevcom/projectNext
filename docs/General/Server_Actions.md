# General Note on Using Server Actions
In this project we use server actions as out way to fetch data both on the client and server. You should think of server actions as a layer of abstraction between prisma and getting data.

The main thing that makes serverActions quite unique is that you can call them both on the client and the server. They are also often used in forms i.e. they are called on form submition.
