 * A committee logo, drawn as a mask filled with a themeable colour when it is a vector.
 *
 * Both cases have to be handled and always will: committee logos are uploaded as svg, but a
 * committee with no logo of its own falls back to the DEFAULT_COMMITTEE_LOGO standard image, and the
 * standard collection accepts every extension - so the fallback is raster today, and nothing
 * constrains it to be anything in particular later. `type` is the only trustworthy signal.
 *
 * Anything that is not a vector is rendered as an ordinary image, which is what it has always been.
