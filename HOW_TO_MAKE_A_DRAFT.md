# How to Make a Draft

This guide explains how to create and manage draft content in the Project Next system.

## Creating News Articles as Drafts

When you create a new news article, it will automatically be created as a **draft** (unpublished). This means:

- The article is saved but not visible to regular users
- Only users with admin permissions can see draft articles
- You can edit and preview the content before publishing

### Steps to Create a Draft News Article:

1. **Navigate to News Section**: Go to the news management area
2. **Click "Lag nyhet"** (Create News): This opens the news creation form
3. **Fill in Details**:
   - **Navn** (Name): Enter the article title
   - **Beskrivelse** (Description): Add a brief description
4. **Submit**: Click "Lag nyhet" to create the article

The article will be created as a **draft** automatically - no additional steps needed!

## Managing Draft Status

Once you have a draft article, you can:

### View Draft Status
- Draft articles show an "Utkast" (Draft) badge
- The status is clearly visible in the edit interface

### Publish a Draft
When editing a news article, you'll see publish controls with options:

1. **"Publiser nyhet"** (Publish News): 
   - Makes the article public
   - Sends notifications to users
   - Changes status from draft to published

2. **"Publiser uten varsling"** (Publish without notification):
   - Makes the article public
   - Does NOT send notifications
   - Useful for minor updates or retroactive publishing

### Convert Back to Draft
For published articles, you can:

1. **"Gjør til utkast"** (Make Draft): Unpublishes the article without notification
2. **"Skjul fra nyheter"** (Hide from News): Unpublishes with confirmation dialog

## Admin View

To view all news including drafts:

1. Go to the **News** section
2. Click **"Admin visning"** (Admin View) in the header
3. You'll see articles organized into:
   - **Utkast** (Drafts) - Articles not yet published
   - **Publiserte nyheter** (Published News) - Live articles

Switch back to regular view by clicking **"Vanlig visning"** (Regular View).

## Draft Benefits

Creating content as drafts allows you to:

- ✅ Work on content over time without publishing incomplete articles
- ✅ Preview and test content before making it public  
- ✅ Collaborate with others on content that isn't ready
- ✅ Schedule content by creating drafts and publishing when ready
- ✅ Avoid accidental publication of unfinished work

## Visual Indicators

- **Draft Status**: Yellow "Utkast" badge on article cards in admin view
- **Published Status**: Green "Publisert" indicator in edit interface
- **Admin Views**: Draft articles only visible to authorized users

The draft system ensures content quality and gives you full control over when your content becomes public.
